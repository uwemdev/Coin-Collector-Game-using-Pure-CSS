##About Coin Collector Game
The Coin Collector Game is a lightweight and interactive web-based game where players "collect" coins by interacting with elements styled and animated solely with CSS. The game typically involves coins represented as circular elements that change states (e.g., disappear or animate) when clicked. CSS transitions, keyframes, and pseudo-classes like :hover or :active create dynamic effects such as bouncing coins, score counters, or level progressions, all without JavaScript or external frameworks. It's an excellent demonstration of CSS's creative potential for crafting simple, engaging experiences.
